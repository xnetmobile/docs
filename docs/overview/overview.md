# Overview

Demand for fast and reliable mobile connectivity continues to grow at a rapid pace and traditional Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MNVOs) are struggling to keep up with this demand. MNOs and MNVOs are desperately looking for zero-CapEx access to alternative coverage through Carrier Grade Wi-Fi or LTE/5G interconnects. 

**This is where XNET comes in.**

Despite growth in consumer data appetites, little has changed in the mobile wireless network industry in decades. We believe this is a sector ripe for disruption and positive change.

*Connectivity is a human right*, yet many parts of the US and the world lack cost-effective, reliable mobile wireless service. More importantly, the tools don’t exist for entrepreneurial builders to meet the needs of their community – and get paid for it.

- XNET is a new approach to bringing LTE/5G mobile connectivity and carrier-grade Wi-Fi offload to consumers and businesses.

- XNET uses Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) spectrum, Wi-Fi version 6+, and a community of network operators coordinated using blockchain technology on Solana. 

- XNET will own no spectrum and very little physical network infrastructure. 

- Instead, XNET will empower its community of builders to harness the XNET LTE/5G core and plug into exclusive carrier Wi-Fi offload agreements. 

A crypto-powered wireless network is not new - and we see much to improve upon. With a team of mobile network technology/operations veterans, XNET will improve upon the haphazard network deployment structure and misguided roadmaps within the decentralized wireless industry. 

## Mobile Networks Today

Over the last three decades, the mobile connectivity market in the United States has undergone a substantial consolidation and is now dominated by a small number of large Mobile Network Operators. The story has unfolded much the same way outside the United States. Centralization provides conceptual simplicity but also fragility, and makes scaling such networks a costly challenge for providers.

- Nations extract hundreds of billions in taxes from network operators in the form of spectrum licenses. 

- The skyrocketing costs of capital and labor make network improvements a non-starter.

- Tower rent always goes up, decoupled from cell tower productivity.

The high barriers to entry from spectrum licensing and infrastructure costs have resulted in a stagnant, anticompetitive industry. Paradoxically, despite the high demand for mobile data, MNOs struggle to keep up. Notably, the US Mobile industry is particularly focused on tracking market churn within a fixed subscriber base as 1 million Americans switch between networks monthly due to poor experiences or the ever decreasing switching costs.

## Decentralized Networks

We believe decentralized wireless networks not only make technological sense, but business sense.

- In the 2020's with the advent of CBRS and Wi-Fi 6+, there has never been more freely available spectrum.

- Decentralization aligns the incentives of network deployers and their partners, from rooftop owners and cafe operators all the way to traditional Mobile Network offload partners. 

- XNET gives the power to individuals to bring LTE/5G or Carrier Wi-Fi offload where it is needed most.

## XNET’s Heterogeneous Network

There has never been more freely available spectrum than now, and there has never been a more mature industry toolkit of offload and secure interconnect technologies. XNET is building a backbone of technology offerings which span different bands like 2.4, 3.5, and 5.0 GHz and communication protocols like LTE, 5G, Wi-Fi 6, and Wi-Fi 7.

At XNET, we refer to our wireless network approach as a **Heterogeneous Network**, which combines different protocols, different bands, and different hardware with one goal in mind: give builders the best opportunities to meet society's relentless desire for more wireless bandwidth. These hybrid network tools are meant to deployed in layers, with Wi-Fi radios working alongside LTE/5G, as one seamless concert of wireless goods.
