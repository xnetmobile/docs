**[XNET API repository](https://github.com/xnetmobile/api) can be found on our GitHub.**


## Introduction
The **XNET API** is a unified public interface designed to empower XNET participants with seamless programmatic access to a wide range of digital resources. Built to manage and retrieve information about devices, venues, wallets, organizations, and user accounts, this API serves as the backbone of the emerging XNET core system.

**Key Highlights:**

- **Resource Management:**  
  The primary focus of the current phase 1 is on managing critical XNET assetsâ€”making it easier for deployers and organizations to maintain, monitor, and update devices, venues, and related components.

- **Future-Ready:**  
  While phase 1 concentrates on resource management, future iterations of the API promise enhanced functionalityâ€”including a revamped explorer tool in phase 2, live usage and accounting statistics in phase 3, and continuous upgrades in subsequent phases.

The **XNET API** is not just about data retrievalâ€”itâ€™s about providing a dynamic, scalable platform that evolves with the needs of its users, ensuring efficient resource management today and delivering innovative tools for tomorrow.
