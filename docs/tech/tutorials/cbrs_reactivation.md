# CBRS Reactivation Walkthrough Guide

Welcome to the XNET CBRS Reactivation Guide! In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of creating your new XNET login account and reactivating your XNET CBRS radios. Please follow each step carefully to ensure a smooth reactivation experience.

Let's get started!

## Creating your new XNET Account

This step may not be necessary, depending on your situation. If you have previously reactivated a WiFi device and your WiFi and CBRS devices were previously registered under the same email address, you can sign in with your existing account and skip to the “Reactivating your CBRS Devices” section of this guide.

Steps:

1. Go to [activate.xnet.world](https://activate.xnet.world) and select CBRS from the dropdown.

2. Select Sign Up from the Login Page.

3. Create a New XNET login account by ﬁlling the required ﬁelds.

    </a>

    !!! Note
        If you are reactivating, you must use the same email from your previous account login but choose a New Password. Otherwise, you will not be able to see your existing radios.

## Reactivating Your CBRS Devices

Steps:

1. Once signed into the activation portal, choose your device from the “XNode ID” dropdown list. Note: Only your CBRS devices will appear in this activation form. You will see a warning symbol next to every device that has not been reactivated and a check mark next to devices that have been successfully reactivated.

2. Next, Select a deployment venue from the “My Venues” dropdown ﬁeld. Ensure that all the relevant ﬁelds are ﬁlled in for the venue you have chosen, if they are not, update the ﬁelds and they will save for that location when you submit the rest of the form.
