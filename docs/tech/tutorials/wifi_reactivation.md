## Reactivating Your Wi-Fi Devices

Steps:

1. Once logged into the activation portal, choose your device from the “Serial Number” dropdown list. Note: Only your Wi-Fi devices will appear in this activation form. You will see a warning symbol next to every device that has not been reactivated and a check mark next to devices that have been successfully reactivated.

2. Next, Select a site location from the “My Venues” dropdown field. Ensure that all the relevant fields are filled in for the venue you have chosen, if they are not, update the fields and they will save for that location when you submit the rest of the form.

3. Users now have the option to “Create A New Site” if you don’t see one of your venue locations or need to create a new one. From the My Venues dropdown, select the Create A New Site option. This will bring you to a new page where you can fill in all the relevant information about your new venue. Once you have filled in all the required fields, your new site will show up in the My Venues dropdown as the venue name you assigned it.

4. When selecting a deployment site from the My Venues dropdown, it
should auto-populate the “Deployment Site Address” fields and other
relevant information about the site. Please ensure that the information is
correct and that additional site information is included if available, such as
Suite, Floor, or Building Number. You will also be required to add the
On-Site Contact Full Name & Phone Number.
