## Installation Best Practices

### Indoor vs. Outdoor Installation Techniques

**Indoor Installation:** When installing APs indoors, focus on placing them in open areas away from walls and large metal objects that can block the signal. Ceiling or high wall installations are typically ideal. Ensure that the AP is positioned to cover the maximum area while avoiding interference from other devices.

**Outdoor Installation:** Outdoor APs should be mounted on poles or walls at a height of **15-30 feet**. This elevation is optimal for both signal propagation and security. Always ground your outdoor APs to protect them from electrical surges. Use a **lightning arrestor** if the area is prone to thunderstorms. Make sure the APs are weatherproofed and have proper environmental protection to withstand the elements.

### Grounding Your Outdoor Installation (Outdoor APs only)

**Grounding** is essential for protecting your outdoor APs from lightning strikes and electrical surges. Always use a grounding rod and connect it to the AP’s grounding terminal. Ensure that the grounding system meets the local **National Electrical Code (NEC)** standards. **Grounding** not only protects the hardware but also ensures the safety of the entire network setup.

### Optimizing Placement of Indoor APs

For indoor installations, the placement of **XNET Access Points (APs)** is crucial to ensure optimal coverage and consistent network performance. Correct positioning can minimize dead zones, reduce interference, and maximize the number of connected devices.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_NMS4bs8_II?si=lujel879LxX3fnnI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

#### Central Location is Key

The most effective way to achieve broad coverage is by placing the AP in a **central location** relative to the area that needs coverage. This allows the signal to radiate outward evenly, covering all corners of the space. When choosing the central location, consider the layout of the space—whether it's an open office, a residential area, or a commercial venue—and ensure the AP is as equidistant as possible from the farthest points that need coverage.

#### Avoiding Physical Obstacles

**Physical obstacles** such as walls, floors, and large metal objects can significantly degrade the signal strength. Thick walls made of concrete or brick, as well as floors between levels, are particularly problematic as they can block or weaken the WiFi signal. To optimize signal propagation:

- **Keep the AP elevated:** Mount the AP on the ceiling or high on a wall to reduce interference from furniture and other low-level obstructions.
- **Minimize proximity to metal objects:** Metal can reflect and absorb WiFi signals, leading to poor performance. Place the AP away from large metal objects like filing cabinets, metal shelving, or large appliances.
- **Avoid corners:** Corners and tight spaces can trap and absorb the WiFi signal, reducing its reach. Place the AP in open areas to ensure the signal can spread effectively.

#### Choosing Between Omnidirectional and Directional Antennas

The type of antenna you use plays a significant role in how the WiFi signal is distributed throughout the space. 

> *XNET only offers Omni directional by default, if you want a directional varient you'll have to place a special order.*

- **Omnidirectional Antennas:** These antennas broadcast the signal in all directions equally, making them ideal for most general-purpose installations. They work best in open areas where coverage is needed across a broad area, such as open-plan offices, lobbies, or large rooms.
  
- **Directional Antennas:** If you need to focus the signal in a specific direction, such as down a long hallway or toward a specific section of a building, **directional antennas** are the better choice. These antennas concentrate the signal in a particular direction, providing stronger coverage in the desired area while minimizing interference in other directions.

#### Additional Tips for Optimal Placement

- **Height Matters:** For most indoor environments, the AP should be placed between 8 to 12 feet above the ground. This height is ideal for both minimizing interference from objects and maximizing coverage.
- **Consider User Density:** In areas with a high density of users, such as conference rooms or classrooms, it may be beneficial to use multiple APs spaced evenly to avoid overloading a single unit.
- **Test and Adjust:** After initial installation, use a WiFi analysis tool like **WiFiAnalyzer** to check the coverage and make adjustments as needed. Fine-tuning the position can significantly improve network performance.

By carefully considering these factors, you can optimize the placement of indoor APs to ensure reliable, high-performance WiFi coverage throughout the installation area.

### Brief Intro to Radio Line of Sight (LoS) vs. Actual Line of Sight

**Radio Line of Sight (LoS)** refers to the ideal path, within what is called a **Fresnel Zone**, that radio waves travel between two points, unobstructed by physical objects. However, **Actual Line of Sight** is what you see visually, which may include obstacles like trees, buildings, or terrain. Understanding the difference is important for optimizing signal strength, especially in outdoor installations.

### Understanding the Squared Cube Law and Calculating Azimuth and Elevation

The **Squared Cube Law** explains that as you scale up a network, the area covered by the AP increases by the square of the distance, but the volume or capacity grows by the cube. This means you must carefully plan the number and placement of APs to avoid dead zones. Use tools like **Radio Mobile** to calculate the **azimuth and elevation** angles for your APs, ensuring optimal signal distribution.

## On-Site Security Considerations

You don't need to know what these are, but you need to be generally aware of if they exist on your network that you're installing them.

### Implementing VLANs and VRFs

**Virtual LANs (VLANs)** and **Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRFs)** are essential for network segmentation and security. VLANs help isolate different types of traffic, such as guest and internal traffic, reducing the risk of cross-network contamination. **VRFs** provide an extra layer of security by allowing multiple routing tables to coexist on the same physical router.

### Utilizing DNS Sinkholing, IDS/IPS, and Threat Prevention

**DNS Sinkholing** is a technique used to redirect malicious traffic away from its intended destination, effectively neutralizing threats. Implementing **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** and **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)** will help you monitor and block suspicious activity on the network. Always have **threat prevention mechanisms** in place to safeguard against potential cyberattacks.
