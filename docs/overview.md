# Overview

Demand for fast and reliable mobile connectivity continues to grow at a rapid pace and traditional Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MNVOs) are struggling to keep up with this demand. MNOs and MNVOs are desperately looking for zero-CapEx access to alternative coverage through Carrier Grade Wi-Fi or LTE/5G interconnects. 

**This is where XNET comes in.**

Despite growth in consumer data appetites, little has changed in the mobile wireless network industry in decades. We believe this is a sector ripe for disruption and positive change.

*Connectivity is a human right*, yet many parts of the US and the world lack cost-effective, reliable mobile wireless service. More importantly, the tools don’t exist for entrepreneurial builders to meet the needs of their community – and get paid for it.

- XNET is a new approach to bringing LTE/5G mobile connectivity and carrier-grade Wi-Fi offload to consumers and businesses.

- XNET uses Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) spectrum, Wi-Fi version 6+, and a community of network operators coordinated using blockchain technology on Solana. 

- XNET will own no spectrum and very little physical network infrastructure. 

- Instead, XNET will empower its community of builders to harness the XNET LTE/5G core and plug into exclusive carrier Wi-Fi offload agreements. 

A crypto-powered wireless network is not new - and we see much to improve upon. With a team of mobile network technology/operations veterans, XNET will improve upon the haphazard network deployment structure and misguided roadmaps within the decentralized wireless industry. 

## Mobile Networks Today

Over the last three decades, the mobile connectivity market in the United States has undergone a substantial consolidation and is now dominated by a small number of large Mobile Network Operators: AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. The story has unfolded much the same way outside the United States. Centralization provides conceptual simplicity but also fragility, and makes scaling such networks a costly challenge for providers.

- Nations extract hundreds of billions in taxes from network operators in the form of spectrum licenses. 

- The skyrocketing costs of capital and labor make network improvements a non-starter.

- Tower rent always goes up, decoupled from cell tower productivity.

The high barriers to entry from spectrum licensing and infrastructure costs have resulted in a stagnant, anticompetitive industry. Paradoxically, despite the high demand for mobile data, MNOs struggle to keep up. Notably, the US Mobile industry is particularly focused on tracking market churn within a fixed subscriber base as 1 million Americans switch between networks monthly due to poor experiences or the ever decreasing switching costs.

## Decentralized Networks

We believe decentralized wireless networks not only make technological sense, but business sense.

- In the 2020's with the advent of CBRS and Wi-Fi 6+, there has never been more freely available spectrum.

- Decentralization aligns the incentives of network deployers and their partners, from rooftop owners and cafe operators all the way to traditional Mobile Network offload partners. 

- XNET gives the power to individuals to bring LTE/5G or Carrier Wi-Fi offload where it is needed most.

## XNET’s Heterogeneous Network

There has never been more freely available spectrum than now, and there has never been a more mature industry toolkit of offload and secure interconnect technologies. XNET is building a backbone of technology offerings which span different bands like 2.4, 3.5, and 5.0 GHz and communication protocols like LTE, 5G, Wi-Fi 6, and Wi-Fi 7.

At XNET, we refer to our wireless network approach as a **Heterogeneous Network**, which combines different protocols, different bands, and different hardware with one goal in mind: give builders the best opportunities to meet society's relentless desire for more wireless bandwidth. These hybrid network tools are meant to deployed in layers, with Wi-Fi radios working alongside LTE/5G, as one seamless concert of wireless goods.
