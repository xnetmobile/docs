# The XNET Token

## Overview

As of September 2024, $XNET has successfully migrated to the Solana blockchain. $XNET is an SPL-Token 2022 with a maximum supply of 2,400,000,000 (two billion, four hundred million) deflationary tokens ($XNET).

## Economics

For the XNET network to thrive, its economic model must benefit all participants. The $XNET Token serves as the bridge between two key groups:

- **Node Operators** – individuals or businesses who build and maintain the network’s physical infrastructure.
- **Mobile Network Operators (MNOs)** – who pay to utilize the coverage created by these node operators.

Node operators are rewarded in $XNET Tokens for their contributions, while MNOs, as the end-users of the XNET Network, pay for access through carrier offload services.


!!! Note
    MNOs exclusively settle payments in fiat currency, and the XNET Foundation acts as the critical link between the fiat world and the $XNET token economy. A majority of the offload revenue generated is used by the Foundation to purchase $XNET on the open market and burn it—slowly helping to further reduce the overall token supply.

## Earning `$XNET`

Token distribution follows the end of XNET Epochs, each epoch lasts two weeks and ends on Sunday. Epoch 1 began on November 28th, 2022. The amount of tokens each deployer receives is based on numerous vectors such as the hardware deployed, uptime, data throughput and location.

!!! TIP
    Token rewards will require ongoing oversight and are likely to fluctuate over time. As the number of node operators grows and new technologies emerge, the XNET Foundation Working Group, in collaboration with community made XIP proposals, will actively adjust emissions to ensure the network's sustainability as it continues to scale.

**For CBRS radios only:**

- Radios achieving **50-75% uptime during an Epoch** will qualify for **50% of the maximum total $XNET** CV rewards for that period.
- Radios that achieve **99.9% or higher uptime during an Epoch** will qualify for an **additional 10% bonus atop the maximum $XNET** rewards they are eligible for in that Epoch.
