**Converting from Solana Wormhole Wrapped `$(W)XNET` to New `$XNET` Token on Solana**

This documentation outlines the steps to convert your Solana Wrapped Wormhole `$(W)XNET` tokens to the new XNET Solana tokens with the contract address `xNETbUB7cRb3AAu2pNG2pUwQcJ2BHcktfvSB8x1Pq6L`.

For the purposes of this document, when we refer to the Solana wrapped XNET, we will use `$(W)XNET`, and for the final migrated token on Solana, we will refer to it as just (`$XNET`).

The process flow is `$(W)XNET -> $XNET`.

**Notes and Important Considerations:**

- You must use a desktop browser for this process.
- You must use a browser that does not have any wallet installed except Phantom.
- If you do not follow these instructions, you’re on your own. We can not, unfortunately, support every combination of app, wallet, chain, etc.
- Please disable any other wallet in your browser that isn’t Phantom wallet.
- You will need about $5-10 USD of Solana to complete this Conversion.
- This process is tested to work. Be very sure you follow this process exactly.
